  h3 What will do Hupothesis ?

  p.
    Hupothesis is in active development and possibilities are almost infinite. Using the large number of Internet users whose profile are so different, the tool could allow great scientific enhancements. In a short term we want to integrate a basic poll system for scientific assumptions on large scale based profiles. This way we want others websites to integrate polls for more visibility.

  h3 Will Hupothesis become “social” ?

  p.
    The importance of online social networks is increasing a lot and is taking more importance in our lives. For these reasons Hupothesis will greatly rely on social network sharing allowing you to access a large number of users. But this social network use need to be carefully done so we do not have a unique persona profile for your hypothesis validation, this is why we're still working on it.
